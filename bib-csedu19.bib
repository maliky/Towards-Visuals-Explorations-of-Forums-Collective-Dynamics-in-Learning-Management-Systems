  Abstract                 = {Collaborative learning incorporates a social component in distance education to minimize the disadvantages of studying in solitude. Frequent analysis of student interactions is required for assessing collaboration. Collaboration analytics arose as a discipline to study student interactions and to promote active participation in e-learning environments. Unfortunately, researchers have been more focused on finding methods to solve collaboration problems than on explaining the results to tutors and students. Yet if students do not understand the results of collaboration analysis methods, they will rarely follow their advice. In this paper we propose a tool that analyzes student interactions and visually explains the collaboration circumstances to provoke the self-reflection and promote the sensemaking about collaboration. The tool presents a visual explanatory decision tree that graphically highlights student collaboration circumstances and helps to understand the reasoning followed by the tool when prescribing a recommendation. An assessment of the tool has demonstrated: (1) the students collaboration circumstances showed by the tool are easy to understand and (2) the students could realize the possible actions to improve the collaboration process.},

  Abstract                 = {The Social Networks Adapting Pedagogical Practice (SNAPP) tool was developed to provide instructors with the capacity to visualise the evolution of participant relationships within discussions forums. Providing forum facilitators with access to these forms of data visualisations and social network metrics in 'real-time', allows emergent interaction patterns to be analysed and interventions to be undertaken as required. SNAPP essentially serves as an interaction diagnostic tool that assists in bringing the affordances of 'real-time' social network analysis to fruition. This paper details the functional features included in SNAPP 2.0 and how they relate to learning activity intent and participant monitoring. SNAPP 2.0 includes the ability to view the evolution of participant interaction over time and annotate key events that occur along this timeline. This feature is useful in terms of monitoring network evolution and evaluating the impact of intervention strategies on student engagement and connectivity. SNAPP currently supports discussion forums found in popular commercial and open source Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Blackboard, Desire2Learn and Moodle and works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox.},

  Abstract                 = {A Social Learning Network (SLN) emerges when users exchange information on educational topics with structured interactions. The recent proliferation of massively scaled online (human) learning, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), has presented a plethora of research challenges surrounding SLN. In this paper, we ask: How efficient are these networks? We propose a framework in which SLN efficiency is determined by comparing user benefit in the observed network to a benchmark of maximum utility achievable through optimization. Our framework defines the optimal SLN through utility maximization subject to a set of constraints that can be inferred from the network. Through evaluation on four MOOC discussion forum datasets and optimizing over millions of variables, we find that SLN efficiency can be rather low (from 68\% to 82\% depending on the specific parameters and dataset), which indicates that much can be gained through optimization. We find that the gains in global utility (i.e., average across users) can be obtained without making the distribution of local utilities (i.e., utility of individual users) less fair. We also discuss ways of realizing the optimal network in practice, through curated news feeds in online SLN.},

We use a treeview to show attributes and their domains, a histogram of their representativity in the data set and as a compact overview of attribute-related facts. A second view shows both attributes and observations. We use a Voronoi diagram whose cells can be interactively merged to discover salient attributes, cluster values and bin categories. Bar chart legends help assigning meaning to the 2D view axes and 2D point clusters. We illustrate our techniques with real-world application data.},

But there are no robust, published data that describe who is taking these courses and why they are doing so. As such, we do not yet know how transformative the MOOC phenomenon can or will be. We conducted an online survey of students enrolled in at least one of the University of Pennsylvania’s 32 MOOCs offed on the Coursera platform. The student population tends to be young, well educated, and employed, with a majority from developed countries. There are significantly more males than females taking MOOCs, especially in BRIC and other developing countries. Students’ main reasons for taking a MOOC are advancing in their current job and satisfying curiosity. The individuals the MOOC revolution is supposed to help the most — those without access to higher education in developing countries — are underrepresented among the early adopters.},

  Abstract                 = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

  Abstract                 = {Designing Learning Analytic (LA) dashboards can be a challenging and complex task when dealing withabundant data generated from heterogeneous sources with various uses. On top of that, each dashboard isdesigned in accordance with the user's needs and their observational objectives. Therefore, understanding thecontext of LA and its users is compulsory as it is part of the dashboard design approach.Our research effort starts with an exploratory study of different contextual elements that could help us definewhat an adaptive dashboard is and how it fulfills the user's needs. To do so, we have conducted a needsassessment to characterize the user profiles, their activities, their visualization preferences and objectives whenusing a dedicated dashboard. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual model, which will be used to generate a variety of LA dashboards. Our main goal is to provide users with adaptive dashboards, generated accordinglyto their context of use while satisfying the users' requirements. We also discussed the implementation processof our first prototype as well as further improvements.},

Comment cette invention culturelle, trop récente pour avoir influencé notre évolution, trouve-t-elle sa place dans notre cortex ? Voici qu’émerge une nouvelle science de la lecture. Tandis que l’imagerie cérébrale en révèle les circuits corticaux, la psychologie en dissèque les mécanismes. Ces résultats inédits conduisent à une hypothèse scientifique nouvelle. Au cours de l’acquisition de la lecture, nos circuits neuronaux, conçus pour la reconnaissance des objets, doivent se recycler pour déchiffrer l’écriture – une reconversion lente, partielle, difficile, qui explique les échecs des enfants et suggère de nouvelles pistes pédagogiques. Qu’est-ce que la dyslexie ? Certaines méthodes d’enseignement de la lecture sont-elles meilleures que d’autres ? Pourquoi la méthode globale est-elle incompatible avec l’architecture de notre cerveau ? Utilise-t-on les mêmes aires cérébrales pour lire le français, le chinois ou l’hébreu ? La lecture subliminale existe-t-elle ? Autant de questions auxquelles Stanislas Dehaene, spécialiste de la psychologie et de l’imagerie cérébrale, apporte l’éclairage des avancées les plus récentes des neurosciences. ﻿Stanislas Dehaene est professeur au Collège de France, titulaire de la chaire de psychologie cognitive expérimentale et membre de l’Académie des sciences.

  Abstract                 = {Along with significant opportunities, Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide major challenges to students (keeping track of course materials and effectively interacting with teachers and fellow students), teachers (managing thousands of students and supporting their learning progress), researchers (understanding how students interact with materials and each other), and MOOC platform developers (supporting effective course design and delivery in a scalable way). This article demonstrates the use of data analysis and visualization as a means to empower students, teachers, researchers, and platform developers by making large volumes of data easy to understand. First, we introduce the insight needs of different stakeholder groups. Second, we compare the wide variety of data provided by major MOOC platforms. Third, we present a novel framework that distinguishes visualizations by the type of questions they answer. We then review the state of the art MOOC visual analytics using a tabulation of stakeholder needs versus visual analytics workflow types. Finally, we present new data analysis and visualization workflows for statistical, geospatial, and topical insights. The workflows have been optimized and validated in the Information Visualization MOOC (IVMOOC) annually taught at Indiana University since 2013. All workflows, sample data, and visualizations are provided at http://cns.iu.edu/2016-MOOCVis.html.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans are good at performing visual tasks, but experimental measurements have revealed substantial biases in the perception of basic visual attributes. An appealing hypothesis is that these biases arise through a process of statistical inference, in which information from noisy measurements is fused with a probabilistic model of the environment. However, such inference is optimal only if the observer's internal model matches the environment. We found this to be the case. We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs. In addition, we determined how a neural population could embed probabilistic information responsible for such biases.},

  Abstract                 = {Interpersonal ties, such as strong ties and weak ties, describe the information carried by an edge in social network. Tracking the dynamic changes of interpersonal ties can thus enhance our understanding of the evolution of a complex network. Nevertheless, existing studies in dynamic network visualization mostly focus on the temporal changes of nodes or structures of the network without an adequate support of analysis and exploration of the temporal changes of interpersonal ties. In this paper, we introduce a new visual analytics method that enables interactive analysis and exploration of the dynamic changes of interpersonal ties. The method integrates four well-linked visualizations, including a scatterplot, a pixelbar chart, a layered graph, and a node–link diagram, to allow for multi-perspective analysis of the evolution of interpersonal ties. The scatterplot created by multi-dimensional scaling can help reveal the clusters of ties and detect abnormal ties, while other visualizations allow users to explore the clusters of ties interactively from different perspectives. Two case studies have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.Graphical abstractOpen image in new window},

  Abstract                 = {We present VisMap, a Web-based software tool that supports student exploration of possible data visualizations during a typical process of data science practice. Specifically, we detail visualization approaches within three major kinds of data analysis (part-to-whole and rank, correlation, and geospatial) and discuss how VisMap allows students to visually explore visualization options that correspond to the kind of analysis. The discussion is rooted in our experiences developing an introductory undergraduate course in data science and in our classroom observations of the limitations of existing software tools. These limitations include inefficiency of visualization comparison, difficulty in manipulating data to achieve visualization goals, and current challenges novices face when using professional tools simultaneous with learning about visualization. We finally offer a variety of future paths to further evaluate and refine VisMap.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been long argued that learning analytics has the potential to act as a “middle space” between the learning sciences and data analytics, creating technical possibilities for exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. One common learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a support tool for teachers and learners alike that allows them to gain insight into the learning process. Although several related works have scrutinised the state-of-the-art in the field of learning dashboards, none have addressed the theoretical foundation that should inform the design of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our critical examination reveals the most common educational concepts and the context in which they have been applied. We find evidence that current designs foster competition between learners rather than knowledge mastery, offering misguided frames of reference for comparison.},

This chapter analyzes how more novel visualization techniques can be used to enhance various activities during the learning process: finding and understanding educational resources, collaboration with learners and teachers, (self-) reflecting about learners’ progress, and designing learning experiences. We illustrate our analysis with example tools and visualizations. Results of our analysis indicate that visualization techniques are beginning to be more widely used for learning but further research is needed to assess the added value of these visual approaches in terms of effectiveness, efficiency or other criteria that pertain to learning.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract
Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the network of collaborations, identifying the key players, potential future collaborators, and trends in the field are very important to carry out a project successfully. In this paper, we present CommunityExplorer, a visualization framework that facilitates presenting, exploring, and understanding the network of collaborations at once. The framework performs data extraction, parsing, and modeling automatically. It is easy to adopt and utilizes a bigraph visualization that scales well.We demonstrate the advantage of CommunityExplorer to identify the collaboration of authors on 346 and 104 research papers published in SOTFVIS/VISSOFT and IWST communities respectively. We found that even though SOFTVIS/VISSOFT has more contributors, IWST exhibits more collaboration.We discovered that contributors in IWST are more resilient than those in SOFTVIS/VISSOFT, which are more volatile. Moreover, collaboration in IWST is concentrated in a single large group, while in SOFTVIS/VISSOFT it is spread among many tiny groups and a few medium-sized ones.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a study that investigates the influence of different types of visualizations on collaboration. The visualizations present the group's performance either in a more cooperative or more competitive way. Decades of research suggest that cooperation leads to greater productivity than competition. However, most of the existing group mirror visualizations achieve an increase in productivity and better self-regulation by enabling a direct comparison of performance within the group. We conducted a repeated measures study with 12 groups that were supported by visualizations that displayed the number of ideas of a brainstorming session (1) per person (competitive condition) (2) per group (cooperative condition), (3) per person and per group (mixed condition) and (4) without visualization (baseline).

  Abstract                 = {Learning analytics seek to enhance the learning processes through systematic measurements of learning related data and to provide informative feedback to learners and teachers. Track data from learning management systems (LMS) constitute a main data source for learning analytics. This empirical contribution provides an application of Buckingham Shum and Deakin Crick’s theoretical framework of dispositional learning analytics: an infrastructure that combines learning dispositions data with data extracted from computer-assisted, formative assessments and LMSs. In a large introductory quantitative methods module, 922 students were enrolled in a module based on the principles of blended learning, combining face-to-face problem-based learning sessions with e-tutorials. We investigated the predictive power of learning dispositions, outcomes of continuous formative assessments and other system generated data in modelling student performance of and their potential to generate informative feedback. Using a dynamic, longitudinal perspective, computer-assisted formative assessments seem to be the best predictor for detecting underperforming students and academic performance, while basic LMS data did not substantially predict learning. If timely feedback is crucial, both use-intensity related track data from e-tutorial systems, and learning dispositions, are valuable sources for feedback generation.},

We argue that both components are necessary to explain the nature, use and acquisition of human knowledge, and we introduce a theory-based Bayesian framework for modeling inductive learning and reasoning as statistical inferences over structured knowledge representations.},

In real-world systems, the graph topology is oftentimes not static but changes over time and hence, also the community structure changes. Previous timeline-based approaches either visualize the dynamic graph or the dynamic community structure. In contrast, our approach combines both in a single image and therefore allows users to investigate the community structure together with the underlying dynamic graph. Our optimized ordering of vertices and selection of colours in combination with interactive highlighting techniques increases the traceability of communities along the time axis. Users can identify visual signatures, estimate the reliability of the derived community structure and investigate whether community evolution interacts with changes in the graph topology. The utility of our approach is demonstrated in two application examples.},

As it is time-consuming to manually spot the discussion forums by humans to know the changes and therefore, better tools are needed. In this project, contents of discussion forums of students were extracted into for mining patterns. In our latest experiments, we deployed topic detection and data visualization tools to analyze the discussion forum data better to generate intelligence to understand the how the students are performing in and feeling about the course modules they are taking.},

	abstract = {One of the main computational and scientific challenges in the modern age is to extract useful information from unstructured texts. Topic models are one popular machine-learning approach that infers the latent topical structure of a collection of documents. Despite their success—particularly of the most widely used variant called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—and numerous applications in sociology, history, and linguistics, topic models are known to suffer from severe conceptual and practical problems, for example, a lack of justification for the Bayesian priors, discrepancies with statistical properties of real texts, and the inability to properly choose the number of topics. We obtain a fresh view of the problem of identifying topical structures by relating it to the problem of finding communities in complex networks. We achieve this by representing text corpora as bipartite networks of documents and words. By adapting existing community-detection methods (using a stochastic block model (SBM) with nonparametric priors), we obtain a more versatile and principled framework for topic modeling (for example, it automatically detects the number of topics and hierarchically clusters both the words and documents). The analysis of artificial and real corpora demonstrates that our SBM approach leads to better topic models than LDA in terms of statistical model selection. Our work shows how to formally relate methods from community detection and topic modeling, opening the possibility of cross-fertilization between these two fields.
A new approach to topic models finds topics through community detection in word-document networks.

Researchers have published many articles in the field of topic modeling and applied in various fields such as software engineering, political science, medical and linguistic science, etc. There are various methods for topic modeling, which Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is one of the most popular methods in this field. Researchers have proposed various models based on the LDA in topic modeling. According to previous work, this paper can be very useful and valuable for introducing LDA approaches in topic modeling. In this paper, we investigated scholarly articles highly (between 2003 to 2016) related to Topic Modeling based on LDA to discover the research development, current trends and intellectual structure of topic modeling. Also, we summarize challenges and introduce famous tools and datasets in topic modeling based on LDA.},
